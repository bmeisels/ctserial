# Control Things Serial

ctserial is a security professional's swiss army knife for interacting with raw serial devices

# Usage:

ctserial connect /dev/your-serial-device

This opens the ctserial application conntect to your serial device.  From there you have a prompt to interact with your serial device, complete with tab completion.  For example:

  ctmodbus> sendhex deadc0de
  ctmodbus> send "Dead Code å›½"
  ctmodbus> exit
